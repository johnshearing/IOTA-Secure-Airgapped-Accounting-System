  The form id property below can be used in the function formResponseProcessor perhaps to:
  reset the query form, 
  clear out data in the table in preparation for new data,
  and perhaps to display the filter expression in current use.    
  It might also be used in the function loadUsersListPage which is called to 
  load data on the page when the form is first loaded or any time a query is submitted.    
  Search on the following to see examples of usage in the code.
  <form id="accountEdit1" action="/api/aUsers" method="GET">

    <!-- 
    The line at the end of this comment is interesting because it shows how a field can be addressed by class in the code.
    This has been used when operations must be preformed on several fields in different forms on the same page.
    It might have other uses as well. 
    Also of note is that the field is hidden. This is how information can be tracked behind the scenes.
    This is not being used on this form. This comment is only here for a reminder.

    <!--
    The system defined in this comment will be used to select which fields are displayed when the query is returned.
    We start out with a div of class selectClauseWrapper.
    This div will contain a pulldown menu which will be populated with all the fields from the table when the menu is opened.
    The user will select one of the fields to display which will now be showing on the pulldown menu control.
    when the selection is made, a new blank pulldown menu will now be placed to the right of the first.
    This behavior continues everytime a field is selected from a blank pulldown menu until all the fields have been selected.
    When the user opens any pulldown menu, the code which populates the list will ensure the previously 
    selected fields will be missing from the list and blank menu item will be added at the beginning.
    If the user selects any of the other fields then the selected field will replace the one previously selected
    while the previously selected will now go back onto the list.
    Selecting the blank menu item will cause the entire pulldown menu to disapear and the one on the right
    will take it's place.
    At this point the code must check that a blank pulldown menu exists all the way to the right. 
    If it does not then it must create one there at the end.
    The only way a blank pulldown menu would not already exist is if all the fields have been previously selected.
    As mentioned above, all pulldowns when opened, will be populated with all the fields except those already displayed.
    Also as mentioned a the pulldown list will have a blank menu item at the top of the list.
    Finally and not previously mentioned, when opening a pulldown menu, the code will check for neighbors right and left.
    If there are neighbors found and they are not blank then arrows will also be inserted into the list
    so that the populated pulldowns can switch places with neighbors to the right or to the left.

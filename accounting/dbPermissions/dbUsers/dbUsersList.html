  clear out data in the table in preparation for new data,
  and perhaps to display the filter expression in current use.    
  It might also be used in the function loadUsersListPage which is called to 
  load data on the page when the form is first loaded or any time a query is submitted.

    The line at the end of this comment is interesting because it shows how a field can be addressed by class in the code.
    This has been used when operations must be preformed on several fields in different forms on the same page.
    It might have other uses as well. 
    Also of note is that the field is hidden. This is how information can be tracked behind the scenes.
    This is not being used on this form. This comment is only here for a reminder.

    The system defined in this comment will be used to select which fields are displayed when the query is returned.
    All the behavior described is provided by the function onChangeBehaviorForFieldToDisplaySelector.
    This comment was the specification from which that function was made.
    We start out with a div of class selectClauseWrapper.
    This div will contain a pulldown menu which will be populated with all the fields from the table when the menu is opened.
    There will also be a blank menu option at the top.
    The user will select one of the fields to display which will now be showing on the pulldown menu control.
    When the selection is made, a new blank pulldown menu will now be placed below the first.
    This behavior continues everytime a field is selected from a blank pulldown menu until the amount of
    select elements equals the amount of fields that can be selected.
    When the user opens any pulldown menu, the code which populates the list will ensure the previously 
    selected fields will be missing from the list and blank menu item will be at the top.
    If the user selects any of the other fields then the selected field will replace the one previously selected
    while the previously selected will now go back onto the list.
    Selecting the blank menu item will cause the entire pulldown menu to disapear and the one below will take it's place.
    At this point the code must check that a blank pulldown menu exists at the bottom. 
    If it does not then it must create one there.
    The only way a blank pulldown menu would not already exist is if all the fields have been previously selected.
    As mentioned above, all pulldowns when opened, will be populated with all the fields except those already displayed.
    Also as mentioned, a the pulldown list will have a blank menu item at the top of the list.

    The system defined in this comment will define the where clause filter used to choose which records will be displayed.
    All the behavior described is provided by the function onChangeBehaviorForConjunctionSelector.    
    We start out with a div of class whereClauseGroupWrapper.
    This div will contain three pulldown menus and an input text box.
    The first pulldown menu contains all the fields which might be examined for a condition.
    The second pulldown menu contains a list of comparison operators.
    The input text box contains the condition to be compared.
    The third pulldown menu contains a conjunction (and or) so that a new filter can be added if desired.
    After the first three elements have be filled out the code will generate another set of 
    elements for a second where clause if a conjunction is added with the fourth pulldown menu.
    This behavior will continue so that there could be an unlimited number of where clause filters.
